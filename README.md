## What is PancakeSwap IFO Pool
PancakeSwap IFO is a fundraising process, conducted through a process called "Lottery system", where users buy lottery ticket to participate using their cryptocurrencies(mostly CAKE-BNB LP tokens) and a random number generator is used to pick users who are eligible to buy the new tokens. This is to prevent those with most money to buy up all the tokens.

PancakeSwap IFO Pool is a mechanism that allows investors to buy newly launched tokens at a discounted price.

## Features

IFO pool allows for equal distribution of new tokens launched in the system while staking their tokens in the liquidity pool.


The IFO pool allows new tokens to be locked for a period of time until after the launch to prevent decrease in price of new token and also allows for public contributions as to which project is to be launched on the platform.
And in a case where fundraising target is not reached, the projects continue with the amount raised from the launch.

## How it works

-    Project Application :- A project that need fundraising applies for IFO by providing the project details like its tokenomics, team behind the project and project roadmap to prevent a malicious token launch.

After a thorough reviewing, the project is approved and IFO is scheduled.

- Users Participation :- people participate in this new token launch event by having a certain amount of CAKE locke up
